Students will study the works of relevant theorists and translators and then proceed to apply in practice the most relevant theories. The texts used for translation from English into French will be analyzed not only to expose their textual aspects, i.e. the morpho-syntactical and stylistic qualities, but also their complex situational framework, the interlingual and intercultural \"discourse\". These aspects clearly show the translator to be a participant in a much broader communicative activity than the merely textual and discourages the over dependence on the traditional linguistic model of translation. Topics such as culture and language mediation will be considered. To strengthen student-awareness of cognitive processes, pairs of students will be encouraged to use Think-Aloud Protocols (TAP) whenever possible./ \nCe cours est \u00e0 la fois th\u00e9orique et pratique.
